# Getting Started

Shito is a service from iceBear67, but you can deploy it as your own.

To use `Shito from iceBear67`, add PolarBot ( 0 ) as your friend

To set your own up, make sure you're running latest dev-build [PolarCore](https://github.com/saltedfishclub/PolarCore)
and [RESTful](https://github.com/project-polar/RESTful).
> In fact, PolarCore v4 and RESTful will be REFACTORED later due to their weird design and buggy API.
